    "#### Q1. What is Bayes' theorem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes's theorem(alternatively Bayes' law or Bayes' rule), named after Thomas Bayes,is a mathematical formula that describes the probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. It is often used in statistics and machine learning to update probabilities as new information becomes available. It is a way to calculate the value of P(B|A) with the knowledge of P(A|B). Bayes' theorem allows updating the probability prediction of an event by observing new information of the real world.\n",

    "\n",
    "Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It is denoted by P(A|B), where A and B are two events. P(A|B) would be the probability of event A occurring given that event B has already occurred.\n",

    "Bayes' theorem is a formula used to calculate conditional probabilities. It is based on the idea of reversing the order of conditional probabilities. Bayes' theorem states that:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "where P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of events A and B occurring, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem and conditional probability are related because Bayes' theorem provides a way to calculate conditional probabilities. By rearranging the terms in Bayes' theorem, we can obtain expressions for conditional probabilities such as P(A|B)."
