    "#### Q1. In order to predict house price based on several characteristics, such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, etc., you are developing an SVM regression model. Which regression metric in this situation would be the best to employ?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to predict the house price the best regression metric would be \"Mean Squared Error(MSE)\" or \"Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE)\" regression metric. </br>\n",
    "The mean squared error is a common regression metric that measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. The MSE is often preferred because it gives more weight to large errors, which are especially important in the of house price prediction. The lower the MSE, the better the model's performance.</br>\n",

It quantifies how well the model fits the data in terms of goodness of fit.

MAE is more robust to outliers than MSE, which measures the average of the squared differences between the actual outcome and the predicted outcome. MSE is more sensitive to outliers because it gives more weight to larger errors by squaring them. This means that MSE can be inflated by a few extreme values in the data. "
